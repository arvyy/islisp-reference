(and _form_* ) -> _<object>_
--

and is the sequential logical "and" (or "∧").
_forms_ are evaluated from left to right until either one of them evaluates to nil or else none are left.
If one of them evaluates to nil, then nil is returned from the and; otherwise, the value of the last evaluated form is returned.
The form and is equivalent to the following:

[lisp]
----
(and) ≡ 't
(and form) ≡ form
(and form1 form2 ... formn) ≡ (if form1 (and form2 ... formn) 'nil)

.Examples
[lisp]
----
(and (= 2 2) (> 2 1)) => t
(and (= 2 2) (< 2 1)) => nil
(and (eql 'a 'a) (not (> 1 2))) => t
(let ((x 'a)) (and x (setq x 'b))) => b
(let ((x nil)) (and x (setq x 'b))) => nil

(let ((time 10))
    (if (and (< time 24) (> time 12))
        (- time 12) time))
=> 10

(let ((time 18))
    (if (and (< time 24) (> time 12))
        (- time 12) time))
=> 6
