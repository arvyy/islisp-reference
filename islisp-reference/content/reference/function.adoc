(function [underline]#_function-name_#) -> _<function>_

+#+'[underline]#_function-name_# -> _<function>_
--

This special form denotes a reference to the function named by _function-name_.
This special form is used to refer to identifiers defined by function-defining forms, link:../labels[labels], or link:../flet[flet] which are not in operator position.

`(function _function-name_)` can be written as `#'_function-name_`.

It returns the function object named by _function-name_.

An error shall be signaled if no binding has been established for the identifier in the function namespace of current lexical environment (see link:../<undefined-function>[<undefined-function>]). The consequences are undefined if the _function-name_ names a macro or special form.
