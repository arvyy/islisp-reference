Function bindings are entities established during execution of a prepared link:../labels[labels] or link:../flet[flet] forms or by a function-defining form.
A function binding is an association between an identifier, _function-name_, and a function object that is denoted by _function-name_ - if in operator position - or by `(function _function-name_)` elsewhere (see link:../function[function]).
