(quote [underline]#_obj_#) -> _<object>_

'[underline]#_obj_# -> _<object>_
--

A quoted expression denotes a reference to an object. This notation is used to include any object in an ISLISP text.

The character `'` (apostrophe or single quote) is syntax for quotation. That is, `(quote a) â‰¡ 'a`.

The result of the evaluation of the quote special form is _obj_.

.Examples

'(car l) => (car l)
'(+ 1 2) => (+ 1 2)
'(quote a) => (quote a)
''a => (quote a)

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to alter the value of a quoted expression.
