(defconstant [underline]#name# _form_) -> _<symbol>_
--

This form is used to define a named constant in the variable namespace of the current toplevel scope.
The scope of _name_ is the entire current toplevel scope except the body _form_.

Although _name_ is globally constant, a variable binding for _name_ can be locally established by a binding form.

The result of the evaluation of _form_ is bound to the variable named by _name_.
The binding and the object created as the result of evaluating the second argument are immutable.
The symbol named _name_ is returned.
